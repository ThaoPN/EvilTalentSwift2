# Unit Testing in Swift 2 - The Before & After Story
## Demo code for my talk at Realm 

Into unit testing? If so you've probably found yourself in the dark alleys of Swift unit testing. If you haven't yet dabbled in unit testing, this talk will be an awesome opportunity to get started and charge up your unit testing superpowers. Here I show you three scenarios of unit testing with Swift, and provide you with practical advice for each of them and the implications of the recently introduced version 2 of Swift. 

- Demo 1 : Testable
- Demo 2 : Unit testing error handling code
- Demo 3 : Test coverage

Enjoy!
